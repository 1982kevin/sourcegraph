# Universal code index

Sourcegraph.com contains the universal code index that spans most public repositories on GitHub.com, GitLab.com, and Bitbucket.org.

This index includes most public GitHub.com repositories with more than 20 stars.

If you would like to guarantee your repository is searchable, regardless of star count, there are a number of ways to do that:

* Add a Sourcegraph badge to your GitHub repository README. This will ensure every time a user
  visits your repository on GitHub, it will trigger a refresh on Sourcegraph.

* Alternatively, navigate directly to the URL. Note that this will add your repository once, but updates may be stale
